# AWS Labs (Self-Learning)

This folder documents hands-on cloud practice:
- EC2: launch instance, SSH, basic web server
- IAM: users/roles and policies (see `s3-policy.json` as example)
- S3: create bucket, upload/download objects

## Suggested Next Steps
- Add screenshots of your AWS console (mask secrets).
- Export IaC (e.g., CloudFormation/Terraform) when you learn it.
- Write short postmortems for any issues you solved (great for LinkedIn!).
